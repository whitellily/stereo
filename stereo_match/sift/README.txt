1. Intro

This is a collection of code I've put together to detect SIFT features in images.  It includes a SIFT function library as well as some executables to detect, match, and display keypoints.  For more information on SIFT, refer to the paper by Lowe:Lowe, D. Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints. International Journal of Computer Vision, 60, 2 (2004), pp.91--110.

Or see Lowe's website:
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/

Some of the code also works with affine-invariant features from the code
by the VGG at oxford:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk:5000/~vgg/research/affine/index.html

Also included is a library containing functions to compute transforms from image features using RANSAC.  See match.c for an example of how to use the RANSAC functions.

2. Requirements

All code in this package requires the OpenCV library (known working
version is 2.0):

http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/


/************************************************************************/

3. Running

The following is a list of directories that contain VC++.NET projects
and the functions of the projects:

  *siftFeat	-- Detect SIFT features
  *match	-- Find and match SIFT features in two images
  *dspFeat	-- Display features from a file

You can mess with the global variables in each of the main C files to
adjust parameters, including input and output files.  You might also have
to adjust the project properties depending on how you installed OpenCV.
